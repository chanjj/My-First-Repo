###MASK

> But truly, what man doth not wear a **mask**? 

> For all of us are masked in some way

> Some choose sharp cruelty as their outward face,

> Some put themselves behind a king's façade,

> Some hind behind the mask of bravery,

> Some put on the disguise of arrogance.

> But underneath our masks are we not one?

> Do we not all wish for love, and joy, and peace?

― *Ian Doescher*, William Shakespeare's The Empire Striketh Back
